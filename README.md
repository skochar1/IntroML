Code I wrote to learn basic machine learning skills.

The steps to building and using a model are:

* Define: What type of model will it be? A decision tree? Some other type of model? Some other parameters of the model type are specified too.
* Fit: Capture patterns from provided data. This is the heart of modeling.
* Predict: Just what it sounds like
* Evaluate: Determine how accurate the model's predictions are.
